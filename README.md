# window-focus
Blur out other windows and focus on one

```
git clone https://github.com/takeiteasy/window-focus.git
npm i
./node_modules/.bin/electron . [running window name]
```
**or if you have electron installed globally, just**
```
git clone https://github.com/takeiteasy/window-focus.git
electron . [running window name]
```

**only works on OSX** - relies on AppleScript
could probably be altered to work on other systems
